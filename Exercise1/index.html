		<li>Be sure that you have what you need to make them.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Tissue</li>
				<li>Ribbon/String</li>
				<li>Black Marker</li>
				<li>Tape</li>
				<li>Scissors</li>
			</ul>
	</div>
	<div id="two">
		<img src="images/2.jpg">
		<li><strong>Take a tissue and roll it into a ball.</strong> You will use this as a head for the ghost. If you would like to enlarge the head, add another tissue to it. If you would like to tape it to secure it, then please do so.</li><br><br><br>
	</div>
	<div id="three">
		<img src="images/3.jpg">
		<li><strong>Now that you have your head, take another tissue or two and put them on top of the head.</strong> Once you have it to your liking, take the ribbon and cut a piece of it. Then, tie the ribbon around it making the head stay inside without falling out. If you would like to, tie the ribbon in a bow as a bow tie.</li><br><br><br>
	</div>
	<div id="four">
		<img src="images/4.jpg">
		<li><strong>Once you complete step 3, take your black marker and draw two eyes.</strong> A mouth is optional, but if you would like to make one, just draw a small circle below the eyes so it looks like it might be saying "Boo!"</li><br><br><br>
	</div>
	<div id="five">
		<img src="images/5.jpg">
		<li>If you want to hang it, take your ribbon or string and tape it to the ghost's head on the top and tie or tape the ribbon to wherever you want it to hang from, and you're done.</li><br><br><br>

				<img src="images/21.jpg">
				<li><strong>Be sure you have all of the supplies.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>A Small Pumpkin</li>
						<li>A Balck Sharpie Marker</li>

						<li>A FAke Candle</li>
					</ul>
				</li><br><br><br>

			<div id="jtwo">
				<img src="images/22.jpg">
				<li><strong>Start by drawing a face on your pumpkin with your sharpie marker. </strong>Do the eyes, nose, and mouth however you would like but start with drawing easy shapes so it won't be hard if you chose to carve it. If you wouldn't like to carve it, just leave your drawing and you're done.</li><br><br><br>
			</div>
				<img src="images/23.jpg">
				<li><strong>If you choose to carve your pumpkin, take your knife and cut the top off so it is like a lid on a box.</strong> Make sure that your hole is big enough for your fake candle to fit through. Then, slowly start on the other parts. Cut out the eyes, nose, and mouth.</li><br><br><br>
